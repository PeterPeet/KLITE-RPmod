# KLITE-Tools

KLITE-Tools is a combination of "KoboldAI Lite" and "Tools", because this are user-mods for KoboldAI Lite. They started as a tool to create a black theme for Lite, but grew more and more to a toolset that can do different actions and minor changes to the Lite UI.

In the KoboldAI Lite Advanced Settings Tab click the Button:
![ApplytheUserMod](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/128c9491-c53e-495b-ab93-ea34287aae27)

Then add the source code of the KLITE-Tool and click ok, to activate the Toolbox you want:
![PasteUserMod](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f0464d7-a095-48a4-b472-c7c166defe14)
