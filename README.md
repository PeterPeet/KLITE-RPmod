KLITE-Tools is a combination of "KoboldAI Lite" and "Tools", because this are user-mods for KoboldAI Lite. They started as a tool to create a black theme for Lite, but grew more and more to a toolset that can do different actions and minor changes to the Lite UI.

Highlights:
- Simple avatar system using KoboldAI Lite’s `human_square` and `niko_square` with circular styling
- Persona/Character selection controls with auto-updating avatars
- Group chat mode with managed participants

In the KoboldAI Lite Advanced Settings Tab click the Button:

Then add the source code of the KLITE-Tool and click ok, to activate the Toolbox you want:
